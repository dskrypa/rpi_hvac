Update installed packages via CLI

Note: If there is junk installed that you don't care about, uninstall those packages first to prevent them from slowing
down the update.

Steps:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt full-upgrade
    sudo apt clean


To update Raspberry Pi firmware:

    sudo apt install rpi-update
    sudo rpi-update
